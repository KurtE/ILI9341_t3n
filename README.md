Overview and Warning: 
=====
This is a modified version of the official PJRC ILI9341_t3 library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/ILI9341_t3).
And it is always a Work In Progress.

This library borrows some concepts and functionality like the usage of DMA from another variant library: https://github.com/FrankBoesing/ILI9341_t3DMA

This library was originally created to be able to test out SPI on the newer Teensy boards (3.5 and 3.6), which have multiple SPI busses. Later it was
also adapted to allow this on the Teensy LC as well. 


SPIN
----

This version no longer uses or requires my SPIN library. 
Currently this library uses my SPIN library (https://github.com/KurtE/SPIN), which allows me to use different SPI busses.

As such it no longer accepts a SPIN object to be passed in to the constructor. 

However there is code in place that when the begin method is called.  The paremeters passed in for MISO/MOSI/SCK are 
checked to see if they are valid for the SPI object.  If so SPI is used.  If not and the board type has SPI1, it will check to 
see if those pins are valid for SPI1 and if so use SPI1, if not if there is an SPI2, it will check...


In addition, this code allows the ILI9341 code to work with only one hardware CS pin available, 
which in this case must be used for the DC pin.  This is very useful to support SPI1 on the new T3.5 and T3.6 boards which only
have one CS pin unless you use some form of adapter to use the SPI pins that are on the SDCARD.   

Frame Buffer
------------
The teensy 3.6 and now 3.5 and now the T4.0 have a lot more memory than previous Teensy processors, so on these boards, I borrowed some ideas from the ILI9341_t3DMA library and added code to be able to use a logical Frame Buffer.  To enable this I added a couple of API's 
```c++
    uint8_t useFrameBuffer(boolean b) - if b non-zero it will allocate memory and start using
    void	freeFrameBuffer(void) - Will free up the memory that was used.
    void	updateScreen(void); - Will update the screen with all of your updates...
	void	setFrameBuffer(uint16_t *frame_buffer); - Now have the ability allocate the frame buffer and pass it in, to avoid use of malloc
```
Asynchronous Update support (Frame buffer)
------------------------

The code now has support to use DMA for Asynchronous updates of the screen.  You can choose to do the updates once or in continuous mode.  Note: I mainly use the 
oneshot as I prefer more control on when the screen updates which helps to minimize things like flashing and tearing. 
Some of the New methods for this include: 

```c++
	bool	updateScreenAsync(bool update_cont = false); - Starts an update either one shot or continuous
	void	waitUpdateAsyncComplete(void);  - Wait for any active update to complete
	void	endUpdateAsync();			 - Turn of the continuous mode.
	boolean	asyncUpdateActive(void)      - Lets you know if an async operation is still active
```

Additional APIs
---------------
In addition, this library now has some of the API's and functionality that has been requested in a pull request.  In particular it now supports, the ability to set a clipping rectangle as well as setting an origin that is used with the drawing primitives.   These new API's include:
```c++
	void setOrigin(int16_t x = 0, int16_t y = 0); 
	void getOrigin(int16_t* x, int16_t* y);
	void setClipRect(int16_t x1, int16_t y1, int16_t w, int16_t h); 
	void setClipRect();
```

This library borrows some concepts and functionality from other libraries as well, such as: from the TFT_ILI9341_ESP, https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_ILI9341_ESP, for additional functions:
```c++
    int16_t  drawNumber(long long_num,int poX, int poY);
    int16_t  drawFloat(float floatNumber,int decimal,int poX, int poY);   
    int16_t drawString(const String& string, int poX, int poY);
    int16_t drawString(char string[], int16_t len, int poX, int poY);
    void setTextDatum(uint8_t datum);
```

In addition, scrolling text has been added using appropriate function from, https://github.com/vitormhenrique/ILI9341_t3:
```c++
    void enableScroll(void);
    void resetScrollBackgroundColor(uint16_t color);
    void setScrollTextArea(int16_t x, int16_t y, int16_t w, int16_t h);
    void setScrollBackgroundColor(uint16_t color);
    void scrollTextArea(uint8_t scrollSize);
    void resetScrollBackgroundColor(uint16_t color);
```

Font Support
------------
This library tries to support three different font types.  This includes the original font support that is in the ILI9341_t3 library, which is 
built in system font, as well as the new font format. 

In addition, we added support to use the Adafruit GFX fonts as well. This includes the ability to output the text in Opaque mode. 

The text output support also has been exteneded in a way similar to the RA8875 library to allow for easier centering of text. 

The member function setCursor has been extended in a couple of ways:
```c++
	void setCursor(int16_t x, int16_t y, bool autoCenter=false);
```
if the autoCenter is true, the next text output will be centered at the given x, y location.  Note: this is only true for the NEXT output.  

In addition you can pass in the magic value: ILI9341_t3n::CENTER for x and/or y and the next text output will be centered horizontally and/or vertically centered in the screen. 


Discussion regarding this optimized version:
==========================

http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/26305-Highly-optimized-ILI9341-%28320x240-TFT-color-display%29-library

This version of the library supports the Adafruit displays that use the ILI9341 displays, but in
addition are setup to support the displays that are sold by PJRC, which include:
	http://pjrc.com/store/display_ili9341.html
	http://pjrc.com/store/display_ili9341_touch.html

Note: this library like the ILI9341_t3 library which it is derived from no longer  require any of the Adafruit libraries, such as their Adafruit_ILI9341 and Adafruit_GFX libraries APIS are based on.

Adafruit library info
=======================

But as this code is based of of their work, their original information is included below:

------------------------------------------

This is a library for the Adafruit ILI9341 display products

This library works with the Adafruit 2.8" Touch Shield V2 (SPI)
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651
 
Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required
to interface (RST is optional).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
products from Adafruit!
